# 📈 stock-prediction-app

# 📃 Description

A service that helps predict popular companies' stock prices. The prediction uses machine learning, specifically the SVM model to allow for a degree of error with the upside of a better predicted line for a stock price. The predictions are made available using an API, which then serves a simple frontend application that allows users to register/login, create keys and API secrets, and get information about requests.
